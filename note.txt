CONTROLLERS.

Lets build contoller which will use for authentication also.

Controller Explained Simply ðŸŽ® â†’ ðŸ§ 
Imagine your app is like a restaurant:

Customer (User)
Makes a request (orders food)
Example: "I want to see my profile" (HTTP request to /profile)
Waiter (Router)
Takes the order and forwards it to the right person
Example: "This request goes to the Profile Controller"
Chef (Controller) ðŸŽ¯ (You Are Here!)
Prepares the response (cooks the food)
Talks to the database (checks the fridge for ingredients)
Returns the result (sends the dish to the waiter)
Customer Gets Response
Sees their profile (or gets an error if something went wrong)


Code Example: User Controller

// 1. User asks for their profile
export const getUserProfile = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // 2. Controller "cooks" (logic)
    const user = await User.findById(req.user.id); // Talk to DB
    
    // 3. Serve response
    res.json({ 
      success: true,
      user 
    });
    
  } catch (err) {
    // Handle errors (burnt food?)
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Oops, something went wrong!" });
  }
};

Key Responsibilities of a Controller

Receive Requests (from router)
Process Logic (validate data, talk to database)
Send Responses (success/error messages)

Real-Life Analogy

Restaurant	Backend Code
Customerâ€™s order	HTTP Request (GET /profile)
Waiter	Router (router.get('/profile', getUserProfile))
Chef	Controller (getUserProfile)
Kitchen/Database	Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
Served dish	JSON Response

Why Controllers?

Keep code clean (separate routes from logic)
Reusable (multiple routes can use the same controller)
Easier to debug (all logic in one place)
Think of controllers as the "brain" of your appâ€™s operations! ðŸ§ âš¡


*********************************************************

.Create crontroller folder and controller files in the controller file create a function for controller logics e.g we did for signup, signin and logout.
.Replace the functions in route with the controller funcions and make sure you import them.
