Create Express Server

This code example uses ES6 modules to import and export the Express server, which is a bit different from the CommonJS module system that uses require and module.exports. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Import Express
javascript
Copy
import express from 'express';
This imports the Express library using the ES6 import syntax. This is useful when you're working with modern JavaScript (e.g., when using Babel or running the server in an environment that supports ES6 modules). You need to ensure that your environment is set up to support ES modules. If you're using Node.js version 14+ and have "type": "module" in your package.json, you can use this syntax.

2. Create an Express App
javascript
Copy
const app = express();
Here, the express() function is called to create an instance of an Express application. This app object will be used to define routes and handle requests.

3. Define a Route
javascript
Copy
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the subscription Tracker Api')
})
This sets up a GET route for the root (/) endpoint. When someone visits http://localhost:3000, the server responds with the text "Welcome to the subscription Tracker Api".

req stands for the request object that holds all the information about the incoming request.

res is the response object that you use to send a response back to the client.

4. Start the Server
javascript
Copy
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Subscription Tracker Api is running on http://localhost:3000')
})
The listen() function makes your Express app listen on port 3000. Once the server is running, it logs the message 'Subscription Tracker Api is running on http://localhost:3000' to the console. This tells you that the server is ready to handle incoming requests on that port.

5. Export the App
javascript
Copy
export default app;
This line uses the ES6 export default to export the app object, which can be imported elsewhere if needed (for example, in testing files or for modularization). This is helpful if you want to use the app in other modules or have a clean separation of concerns.

Key Differences in ES6 Module Syntax
import: Used to import dependencies (like express) or other modules.

export default: Used to export a value, function, or object from a module so it can be used elsewhere.

Full Flow Recap:
Create the Express app with express().

Define a route to respond to HTTP requests.

Start the server and listen on port 3000.

Export the app for use in other parts of your project (optional but useful for modularity).
