AUTHENTICATION

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system before granting access to resources, data, or services. It's essentially about ensuring that the entity requesting access is who or what it claims to be.

Basics of what we are going to do:
Registration: Hash the user's password and store it in a secure way (e.g., with bcrypt).

Login: Validate the user's credentials and issue a JWT token if successful.

Protect Routes: Use JWT middleware to ensure only authenticated users can access protected routes.

Logout: Typically handled client-side by removing the token from storage.

This is a basic authentication flow using JWT in an Express.js app. In a real-world scenario, you'd use a database to store users and probably add more security measures like token expiration, refresh tokens, and more.


*******************************************************

1. insstall jsonwebtoken by running npm install jsonwebtoken bcryptjs.
2. go to .env.developement.local and create jwt_secret which isyour string of characters. and we can also define when our jwt will expire.
3. go to env. config file to export those variable.
