WORKFLOW REMINDER

We want to schedule a lot of email reminders before our users hit that subscription deadlines giving them more time to think about whether they want to cancel subscription or keep it going.
To do this we will use upstash. 

Steps:
1. sign up and login to upstash and navigate to workflow.
2. Copy the Qstash url, Qstash_token and sign in keys to your environment variables and use them in env.js file.
3. Now we can install upstash client for express
  a. install it by running npm install @upstash/workflow
  b. so in config folder we will create an upstash file.
  c. We created a new route for workflow in route folder.
  d. we utilise this route in app.js file, make sure it is imported.
  c. In controller folder create a controller file for workflow.
  e. then in sunscription controller we trigger the workflow.
  f. to test your workflow open another terminal and run npx @upstash/qstash-cli dev  and install it they will give you QSTASH_TOKEN dont include SIGNING_KEYS, copy them and add them to your .env.developement.local file. 
  g. move the former QSTASH_TOKEN, Qstash_URL, SIGNING_KEYS to your .env.production.local file.
  h. in sample curl request in your terminal upstash provided a sample url copy from http to 8080 and use it in your .env.developement.local file as Qstash_URL.
  i. in your workflow route pass the sendReminders function and make sure you imported it.
  j. I had some errors concerning http i have to remove process.env in both port and server-url in my .env.developement.local file.
